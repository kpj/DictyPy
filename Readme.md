# DictyPy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kpj/DictyPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kpj/DictyPy)

Group all dicty genes into functional groups and compute respective codon usages.


## Usage

The main functionality can be found in `main.py`.
Furthermore, additional filters can be put into `filters.py`.


## Used Data

All data was acquired from [dictybase](http://dictybase.org/).


## Used Modules

Most of the work is done using the [biopython](http://biopython.org/) module.
